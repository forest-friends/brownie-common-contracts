Common Vyper contracts.

## Testing and Development

### Dependencies

* [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) version 3.6 or greater, python3-dev
* [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) - tested with version [6.11.0](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli/releases/tag/v6.11.0)
